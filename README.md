## Description
**To-Do-Demo** is a To-Do app for Titanium showcasing many best practices and some reusable components.

## Installation
Clone or download this and build using standard Titanium build practices.  The project is written using Alloy... because if you are still using Titanium classic you are just wrong.

```console
ti build -p ios -F iphone
```
OR

```console
ti build -p android -T device
```

## Usage

Should be self-explanatory!  Ask about the usage of any of the components and I'll expand on that part.

## Configuration
The configuration at this moment is for the logger

```javascript
"logger": {
  "enabled": true,         // Enabled or not?  Disable at runtime for more capabilities
  "remoteProvider": "acs", // Want to store your logs to a remote provider?  Plugins needed and slight re-arch
  "remoteLevel": "E",      // What threshold level should logs be sent?
  "fileLevel": "D",        // What threshold level should logs be sent to filesytem? 
  "crittercism": false,    // Use Crittercism?  Why not?  Configure crittercism integration here
  "crittercismIOSAppId": "[YOUR-IOS-APP-ID]",
  "crittercismAndroidAppId": "[YOUR-ANDROID-APP-ID]"
}
```

### Known Issues
While this is a good codebase to model after, there's more than one way to accomplish a task.
I've made a few mistakes before, but... Strive for modularity and feature encapsulation!  Read

* I'm using a lot of components from all over the net and I haven't always remembered where I pulled the bits and pieces. 
* I'd like to give proper attribution so also feel free to create an issue for attribution 
* I've learned from the legends and they are either authors of some of the sub components or directly influenced my Titanium knowledge and thus indirect authors
